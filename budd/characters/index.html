  </a><figcaption>Eris, the main character of BUDD!</figcaption>
  </figure>
</p>
<p><strong>Likes:</strong> Repairing old machines, Retro video games, Relaxing by the ocean.<br>
<strong>Dislikes:</strong> Being bossed around, Wasting money, Strict dress codes.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> A bounty hunter in training newly recruited on board the space colony, MARI-XIII.
After finishing a training mission, she crash lands on planet Verdeo and encounters a <a href="#budd-units">BUDD Unit</a> named Boxer. Together, they look for parts to repair Eris' ship and return to the colony.</p>
<p>She comes from a small port town on a planet out in the middle of nowhere. She would eventually leave home to look for better opportunities, and to better find herself as a person.</p>
<p>Before she was a hunter, she was a skilled mechanic, capable of repairing many types of land, water, and space faring vehicles. Most of her combat experience comes as a necessity to defend against the wildlife on her home planet.</p>
<p><strong>Personality:</strong> Eris is pretty smart when it comes to her own interests, but isn't great at reading other people. She's cocky, and will often act out of impulse without thinking things through. Eris loves to show off whenever she can.
(Truthfully, a lot of this is her trying to overcompensate for her own insecurities she's been trying to work through)</p>
<h2 id="budd-units">B.U.D.D. Units</h2>

</p>
<p>What's a hunter without some support?</p>
<p>Each hunter working aboard MARI-XIII is assigned a BUDD Unit. Each BUDD unit has a variety of different abilities, ranging from combat to exploration, to simple office work. The name BUDD is actually short short for <em>Ballistic Utility &amp; Discovery Device</em>, but nobody ever actually calls them that.</p>
<p>Over the course of the game, Eris befriends three different BUDD units:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Boxer:</strong> A strong and dependable unit, found all by himself on Planet Verdeo. Good with brute force damage, clearing fragile debris, and pushing heavy objects.</li>
<li><strong>Ray:</strong> His previous operator was hurt in the attack on the Mizuli Outpost, and reluctantly tags along with Eris on her quest. He's equipped with twin laser cannons that can pick at foes from a distance and even unleash a laser blast to hit multiple enemies at once.</li>
<li><strong>Coil:</strong> A somewhat fickle and experimental prototype model designed to assist in scaling the mountains of Polarum. He can be used to ascend to heights just out of reach, or to launch and stun monsters in the way. You can even use him as a pogo-stick!</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a few other models Eris will encounter too:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Seeker:</strong> Standard issue for colonists living aboard MARI-XIII, designed for scouting uncharted areas and recording information. Their versatility makes them popular not just with hunters, but the entire colony staff.</li>
<li><strong>Dot:</strong> A caring Seeker unit modified by <a href="#rhea">Rhea</a> to aid in officework around the Colony. Rhea thought the bow looked super cute.</li>
<li><strong>Stratos:</strong> <a href="#operator-ceres">Operator Ceres</a>' personal BUDD unit, designed by her to assist with colony operations. This is a powerful model, able to move at extraordinary speeds and store mass amounts of data, well beyond the capabilities of any other BUDD unit.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rhea">Rhea</h2>
<p>

  </a><figcaption>Rhea, MARI-XIII's friendly secretary</figcaption>
  </figure>
</p>
<p><strong>Likes:</strong> Helping others, Keeping things tidy, Cheesy romance novels, Writing emails.<br>
<strong>Dislikes:</strong> Disrespectful people, Being ignored, Responding to emails.</p>
<p>As an outgoing and supportive go-getter, Rhea is <a href="#operator-ceres">Operator Ceres</a>' assistant and secretary. She also runs MARI-XIII's email server, keeping the colony's hunters up to date on not only their missions, but events regarding the colony. It's Rhea's sworn duty to help the residents of MARI-XIII however she can.</p>
<p>During the game, Rhea will send Eris on her missions after returning to the colony. She's grown quite fond of Eris, and will gladly look out for her to the best of her ailities.</p>
<h2 id="stella">Stella</h2>
<p>
  <figure>
    <img src="sGalleryPixelStella.png" alt="" title="">
  </a><figcaption>A nerd, fascinated in all things technology</figcaption>

</p>
<p>Stella, a scientist and expert on alien fauna.</p>
<p><strong>Likes:</strong> Reading articles, Visiting different ecosystems, Animals<br>
<strong>Dislikes:</strong> Cars, Misinformation, People interrupting her</p>
<p>Stella is the lead astrobiologist for MARI-XIII and an expert in the ecology and wildlife of various planets across the Lumina System. Being an expert in her field, she was assigned to the colony's new research outpost on the ocean planet, Mizuli, to study its wildlife and assist the other colonists in construction.</p>
<p>Things go south when monsters start attacking the outpost in Mizuli, forcing Stella to send a distress signal to <a href="#rhea">Rhea</a> in the colony, begging her for more hunters to help with the situation. It seems something is causing these monsters to act out of line, and she'll need help figuring out exactly what...</p>
<p>Stella can be tonedeaf, and gets way too obsessed with her work, but will gladly share her interests with others willing to listen.</p>
<h2 id="operator-ceres">Operator Ceres</h2>

</p>
<p>Operator Ceres and her own BUDD, Stratos.</p>
<p><strong>Likes:</strong> Bioengineering, Exploring the cosmos, MARI-XIII's staff<br>
<strong>Dislikes:</strong> Being isolated from her peers, Scientific misconduct, Spam emails</p>
<p>In her youth, Ceres was a brilliant scientist conducting studies for the ARCANA corporation. Her research led to advancements in the fields of both bioengineering and sustainable energy. Given her reputation in the scientific community, Ceres was selected to be the administrator for ARCANA's newest colony, MARI-XIII.</p>
<p>Suffering from working for years under dangerous conditions, Ceres opted to have her body augmented from head to toe with cutting edge cybernetics. These augmentations allow Ceres to communicate with the Colony's network, letting MARI-XIII operate as if it were a part of her.</p>
<p>As Eris and Rhea work on missions across the Lumina System, Ceres is forced to confront the uncomfortable truth about her past employment with ARCANA.</p>

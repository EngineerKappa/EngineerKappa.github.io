Games Between Games There and Back A Slice of the Modern Era Left on Verdeo The Present, and the Future of BUDD What do you mean BUDD was an RPG??? Eris&#39; party from StarGame, back when she was only known as &#39;Hunter&#39; or &#39;Swordgal&#39;. Sadly none of the others made it into BUDD as it is now.</description>

      <description>Artwork I&#39;m a digital artist, for the most part. I&#39;ve been drawing all my life, but I only got a tablet sometime around about 2011 or 2012? That&#39;s when I really got serious about improving my art skills. Right now I&#39;m using an XP-Pen tablet and Clip Studio Paint to draw.&#xA;These are drawings I did starting from mid-2022.

      <description>B.U.D.D. What is BUDD? Eris using her first BUDD, Boxer, on Planet Verdeo.&#xD;BUDD is a retro sci-fi adventure platformer game I&#39;ve been working on since 2021! It&#39;s loosely inspired by retro SEGA games I loved, like Monster World IV or the Phantasy Star games.&#xA;It stars Eris, a rookie bounty hunter that&#39;s found herself in the wrong place at the wrong time. She needs to use friendly robots called BUDDs to help her repair her ship, finish jobs for her colony, and then eventually uncover a conspiracy spanning the entire Lumina System.</description>

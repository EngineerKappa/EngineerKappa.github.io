 <em>Welcome to EngineerKappa's River!</em></h1>
<p>Hi there! I'm Anna, also known as EngineerKappa, and occasionally QueenDelta.</p>
<p>I'm an artist, game developer, and all around creative weirdo that's still trying to decide what she wants to do with her life. I'm just doing what I can, and that leads me down all sorts of wacky creative rabbitholes. I don't expect many people to come by, so this is just my own little hub of the various creative projects I've done (or started) over the years.</p>
<p>You can use the navigation bar at the top to check out different projects of mine. Some pages might even have their own subpages, so keep your eyes peeled!</p>

<h2 id="site-updates">Site Updates</h2>
<p><em><strong>09/17/24</strong></em> - Undergoing a <strong>HEAVY</strong> rework of the website! Here are some things to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>The site's now on <a href="http://engineerkappa.net/">http://engineerkappa.net/</a>! I decided to move from Neocities to GitHub Pages because git's honestly way easier to sync files with.</li>
<li>Moving the site's content from pure HTML pages to Markdown documents via the <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> framework. This should make it significantly easier for me to add new stuff to the site! In the meantime, things may break or might not look 1:1 with the old site.</li>
<li>The <a href="/art">art gallery</a> has been totally reworked, and now uses a <a href="https://github.com/mfg92/hugo-shortcode-gallery">Hugo Shortcode Gallery</a> to render images. This also makes it way easier to add new art, at the expense of some flexibility.</li>
<li>Also Added some art I forgot to add since March!</li>
<li>The History of BUDD and BUDD Characters pages are being updated to use Markdown and are somewhat broken at the moment. I also really need to get around to updating the history page with all the stuff that happened since SAGE '23 because a <strong>LOT</strong> has happened.</li>
<li>This isn't related to the site at all, but did you know that BUDD has a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3082080/BUDD/">Steam page</a> now? You should check it out and wishlist my game! Tell your friends to wishlist it too!</li>
</ul>

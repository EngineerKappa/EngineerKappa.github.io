 <em>Welcome to EngineerKappa's River!</em></h1>
<p>Hi there! I'm Anna, also known as EngineerKappa, and occasionally QueenDelta.</p>
<p>I'm an artist, game developer, and all around creative weirdo that's still trying to decide what she wants to do with her life. I'm just doing what I can, and that leads me down all sorts of wacky creative rabbitholes. I don't expect many people to come by, so this is just my own little hub of the various creative projects I've done (or started) over the years.</p>
<p>You can use the navigation bar at the top to check out different projects of mine. Some pages might even have their own subpages, so keep your eyes peeled!</p>

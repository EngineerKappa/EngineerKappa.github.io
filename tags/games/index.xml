      <description>B.U.D.D. What is BUDD? Eris using her first BUDD, Boxer, on Planet Verdeo.&#xD;BUDD is a retro sci-fi adventure platformer game I&#39;ve been working on since 2021! It&#39;s loosely inspired by retro SEGA games I loved, like Monster World IV or the Phantasy Star games.&#xA;It stars Eris, a rookie bounty hunter that&#39;s found herself in the wrong place at the wrong time. She needs to use friendly robots called BUDDs to help her repair her ship, finish jobs for her colony, and then eventually uncover a conspiracy spanning the entire Lumina System.</description>
